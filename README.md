## An Exploration in Java

#### Introduction:
Java is a programming language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995, and it would not be a stretch to say it is now the most popular programming language in existence. It is a general purpose, class-based, object-oriented language. It is somewhat unique in that all of the code must be in classes. Scripting can sort of be done, but it must be inside of a class and then the script can be put inside the main method of that class, here's a hello world program in Java:
``` Java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(string[] args) {
        System.out.println('Hello World!'); // print 'Hello World!' to the console
    }
}
```
